# Introduction to Excel - Learning Summary

Platform:** DataCamp (via GirlLEAD Africa)  
**Duration:** 4 hours  
**Completed:** October 2025  
**Focus:** Building foundational Excel skills for data analysis.

### ðŸ§  Key Things I Learned
- How to navigate Excel efficiently (shortcuts, ribbons, and quick access toolbar)
- Basic formulas and functions (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, IF)
- Sorting and filtering data
- Data validation and conditional formatting
- Pivot tables for summarizing large data
- Structuring clean datasets for analysis

### ðŸŽ¯ Reflection
This course helped me understand how data cleaning and organization form the backbone of analysis. I now see Excel as a *mini lab* where every function tells a data story.
