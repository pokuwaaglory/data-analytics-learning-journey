# Introduction to Excel - Learning Summary

Platform: DataCamp (via GirlLEAD Africa)  
Duration: 4 hours  
Completed:19th October 2025  
Focus: Building foundational Excel skills for data analysis.

### Key Things I Learned
- How to navigate Excel efficiently (shortcuts, ribbons, and quick access toolbar)
- Structuring clean datasets for analysis
âœ¨ Managing and formatting data
âœ¨ Naming ranges & working with sub-totals
âœ¨ Aggregate & arithmetic operations
âœ¨ Summarising sales and calculating profit
âœ¨ Formatting with functions
âœ¨ Visualizing data in Excel (a.k.a. making numbers look good)

Each of these steps brought me closer to understanding how data actually speaks â€” not just in formulas, but in trends, visuals, and real stories behind every dataset.

Iâ€™m still learning, still experimenting, still building.
Thank you for reading this far ðŸ’š

Watch out for my mini-projects where I intend to apply these to real-world data.
