# Data Preparation in Excel — Course Summary

Platform: DataCamp
Duration: 4 hours
Status: Completed
Track: Associate Data Analyst (Excel)

### Overview

This course focused on one of the most underrated but essential parts of analysis — data preparation. Before you can make sense of data, you have to make it make sense.

I learned how to collect, clean, and transform raw data into something reliable and structured — ready for deeper analysis and visualization.

### What I Learned

📌 Sourcing & Importing Data:
How to pull in raw datasets, remove duplicates, handle missing values, and make the data ready for analysis.

📌 Text & Date Functions:
Used formulas to clean and combine text, standardize names, and format dates to make them more meaningful.

📌 Logical Functions:
Created conditional formulas with the IF function and nested IF statements to handle real-life data conditions.

📌 Lookups & PivotTables:
Met VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP — where my Excel confidence was tested and rebuilt. 

Once I finally understood how lookup functions work, I saw how much time they save. Total game-changer.

 ### Key Insight

Data preparation is the foundation of good analysis.
You can’t analyze what isn’t clean, structured, or understood.

### Reflection

I’m proud of this progress — not just for completing the assignment, but for pushing through the frustration until it made sense.
Yes, VLOOKUP humbled me, but it also helped me level up. 💪🏽

### ✅ Next Step:
I’ll be taking Data Visualization in Excel to strengthen how I communicate insights clearly and visually.
